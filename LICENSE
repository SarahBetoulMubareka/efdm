This software currently exists in three different versions: EFDM, European Forestry Dynamics Models for non-even-aged forests (EFDM-nea) and Spatially Explicit Pan-European Forestry Dynamics Model (EFDM-GEO). EFDM was the version first version, while EFDM-geo is the latest release.
The software is a forest growth model with features to rescale management activities to match demand for forest-based commodities. It was conceived as a flexible system for harmonized forestry modelling for all European countries and it is intended to process data from National Forest Inventories. It is a spatially-explicit model, operating on a 1-ha resolution.
Directorate D requested the support of the Central IP Service in order to release EFDM-GEO under a Free/Open Source Software licence (req. id. #EC-IPR00008585). These could be beneficial due to the absence of a known commercial potential and the possibility of third parties using and developing the tool in a way that supports EU forests and forest related to policies, projects and political directives.
The software is released under a Free Free/Open Source Software licence, including under the European Union Public Licence.
