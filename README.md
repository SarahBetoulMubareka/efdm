# EFDM: European Forestry Dynamics Model
The European Forestry Dynamics Model (EFDM) simulates the development of the forest and estimates volume of wood harvested for any given forested area. This estimate can be broken down by, for example, species, site quality, management regime and ownership category. The EFDM was conceived as a flexible system for harmonised forestry modelling. It was developed to process data from Europeâ€™s National Forest Inventories. Since this data is neither standardised nor necessarily available outside of its owner country, the EFDM has been developed as a modular system in freely available software (R).

EFDM was jointly developed by the Natural Resources Institute Finland and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences for the European Commission's Joint Research Centre in the framework of the Specific Contract 10 under FWC388432 in 2013, and was further enhanced under Specific Contract 14 of the same FWC under the expertise of the same developing team. The model is currently functional.

EFDM was conceived as a flexible system for harmonized forestry modelling for all European countries. It is intended to process data from National Forest Inventories. This data is not standardized, nor is it necessarily available outside of its parent country, hence the need for a modular system such as EFDM.
